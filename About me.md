Hey, I'm TheDarkTiefseeEnte07!

I'm a german developer specialising in roblox scripting. 
I am also currently learning the C++ programming language with the help of the Arduino Uno microcontroller.
You can contact me at discord under my username thedarktiefseeente07.
I started with Roblox Studio in April 2021 and then learnt how to script from January 2022.

I hope you enjoy my profile!
